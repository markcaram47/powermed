# Backend (To be implemented)

This folder is reserved for the backend server implementation.

The backend will be implemented later when MongoDB is set up.

## Planned Structure

```
backend/
├── models/          # MongoDB models
├── routes/          # API routes
├── middleware/      # Express middleware
├── server.js        # Express server
└── package.json     # Backend dependencies
```

## When Ready

1. Set up MongoDB (local or Atlas)
2. Install backend dependencies
3. Implement Express server with MongoDB connection
4. Create API routes for products and categories
5. Implement admin authentication

See the main README.md for project structure.
